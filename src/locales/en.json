This authenticity is valuable—but also riskier for brands (you might say the wrong thing). The live format creates trust but limits scale.",

        "why_replay_para": "A YouTube video can accumulate 100K views over months. A Twitch stream reaches your concurrent viewers and that's it. VODs get minimal views (usually 5-10% of live viewership). This means lower total impressions, which justifies lower CPM rates compared to YouTube.",
